						    A card-browser game!<br>
                            Get a card, type the command in the browser. Receive an interpretation of its function, a connected feminist concept and instructions to execute. Serve and be served as you turn into a feminist server yourself by playing and interacting with the cards both online or one-on-one in the space.
						</p>
						<p>
							Through self-reflective and relational qualities, it calls upon the feminist method and literature. A reconsideration of words with a set meaning will occur while playing. The player(s) will get acquainted with important computational terms and commands, which enable associations extending beyond the terminal, into the social and eventually the personal spheres.

						    I started my dutch language course some months ago, and the first thing I was searchin for was a minimalistic irregular verb trainer. I didn't find it unluckily
							so I decided to make my one! Making <b>Trainer ─ Onregelmatige werkwoorden</b> was the perfect way to get back to some html and css after the summer break.

						<b>CyberPoetic zine!</b> is a poetic web based zine project that explores the evolving relationship between poetry and technology. 
						The first issue is called re_authorship.
					</p>
					<p>
						Through a blend of personal experiments and conversations with poets and artist, re_authorship looks into how AI is reshaping poetic 
						and artistic expression. It's a glimpse at the blurred line between human and machine creativity, reflecting on the cultural and ethical 
						implications of algorithmic language generation. By questioning authorship, ownership, and labour, CyberPoetic zine, with its first issue 
						re_authorship, imagines new futures for poetry in the age of AI.<br>
						The zine is also made using Pre Post Print tools (Weasyprint, Paged.js, html2print)

							<b>Pen Plotting Party</b> is a Rotterdam-based collective I’m part of, forged in the dynamic environment of Experimental Publishing at the Piet Zwart Institute. With backgrounds in graphic design, computing science, bookmaking, and mathematic, we bonded over pen plotters, the home office printer's predecessor lost to history. This 'obsolete' technology embodies a dynamic between new and old media, between rapid consumption and slow-paced, seamful performance.
						</p>
						<p>
							We have hosted a(n ongoing) series of events, building community around the multiplicity of methods pen plotters invite. We started with mini-workshops to let people know and experiment with this lost technology in our favourite format: the Pen Plotting Party, where people are invited to play, fix, dance with the plotters.</p>
